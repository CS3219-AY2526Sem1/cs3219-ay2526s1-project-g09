# Matching Service

The Matching Service is a microservice responsible for pairing users based on their preferences.  
It supports submitting match requests, canceling them, and receiving match results in real-time via pub/sub notifications.

---

## Features
- Submit a match request with user preferences.  
- Cancel a pending request.  
- Receive match results when a compatible partner is found.  
- Automatic timeout if no match is found within a configurable duration.  
- Redis pub/sub integration for real-time notifications.  
- MongoDB persistence for user preferences.  

---

## Prerequisites
- [Redis Image 8.2.1](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  

---

## Running Locally

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start:
- `redis` (caching + pub/sub)  
- `matching-service` (instance)  

Service will be available at:
- `http://localhost:5274`

## API Endpoints

### 1. Submit a Match Request
`POST /api/match/request`

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "topics": ["Database"],
  "difficulties": ["Medium"],
  "minTime": "100",
  "maxTime": "200"
}
```

**Response (canceled/overriden):**

HTTP Response: 410 Gone
```json
Match request was cancelled
```

**Response (matched):**

HTTP Status: 200 OK
```json
{
    "userId": "user456",
    "topics": [
        "Database"
    ],
    "difficulties": [
        "Medium"
    ],
    "minTime": 100,
    "maxTime": 200
}
```

**Response (timeout):**
HTTP Status: 

202 Accepted
```json
No match found (timeout)
```

---

### 2. Cancel a Match Request
`DELETE /api/match/cancel-match/{requestId}`
HTTP Status: 204 No Content
**Response:**
```json

```

---

### 3. Get User Preference (for loading preferences)
`GET /api/matching-service/{userId}`

**Response:**
HTTP Status: 200 OK
```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
    "topics": [
        "Easy"
    ],
    "difficulties": [
        "Medium"
    ],
    "minTime": 100,
    "maxTime": 200
}
```

---

## Error Handling
All errors return structured JSON with HTTP status codes. They are logged internally

Example:
```json
{
  "error": "UserPreferenceNotFoundException",
  "message": "No preferences found for userId=user999",
  "location": "MatchingController.java:42"
}
```

---

## Architecture Notes
- **Redis**: Used for pub/sub events (`match-notification`, `cancel-notification`) and sharing data between microservice instances.  
- **MongoDB**: Stores persistent user preferences.  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple instances of the service (e.g., `matching-service-1`, `matching-service-2`) can subscribe to the same Redis channels.  

---

## Configuration
Environment variables:
- `REDIS_HOST` → Redis hostname.  
- `REDIS_PORT` → Redis port.  
- `MONGODB_URI` → MongoDB connection string.  

---

## Example Flow

1. `user123` sends a match request.  
2. `user456` sends a match request.  
3. Service matches them → both futures complete → response returned.  
4. If `user123` cancels before matching, a cancel-notification is published and the request is cleared.
