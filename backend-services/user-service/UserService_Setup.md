## Running User Service

1. Open Command Line/Terminal and navigate into the `user-service` directory.

2. Run the command: `npm install`. This will install all the necessary dependencies.

3. Run the command `npm start` to start the User Service in production mode, or use `npm run dev` for development mode, which includes features like automatic server restart when you make code changes.

4. Using applications like Postman, you can interact with the User Service on port 5277. If you wish to change this, please update the `.env` file.
